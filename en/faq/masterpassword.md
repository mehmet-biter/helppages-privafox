# Why is there a master password?

You can protect your bookmarks as well as your login data with a master password. This is helpful when someone else uses your browser. Prevent prying eyes from seeing your birthday shopping or trip planning bookmarks, and block access to your login information for online accounts: Use the Privafox master password.
